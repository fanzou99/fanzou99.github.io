# Welcome to my personal webpage.

Quick self-introduction: I will be a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Astronomy at University of Michigan starting in August 2024. Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. at The Pennsylvania State University (advisor: Niel Brandt) in 2024 and my B.S. at the University of Science and Technology of China in 2019.
