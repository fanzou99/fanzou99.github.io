# Introduction

Hi, I am a postdoctoral research fellow working with [Elena Gallo](https://public.websites.umich.edu/~egallo/index.html) in the Department of Astronomy at [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/astro). Before that, I received my Ph.D. at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://science.psu.edu/astro) (advisor: [Niel Brandt](https://personal.science.psu.edu/wnb3/)) in 2024 and my B.S. at [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.physics.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) in 2019.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in massive black holes (MBHs) and galaxies, with a strong focus on multiwavelength data covering from X-ray to radio. The symbolic interactions between galaxies and their MBHs have strongly shaped both populations. I have been using active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as probes to understand the MBH-galaxy coevolution across cosmic time. I have a broad spectrum of experience on this topic, covering low (i.e., data) to high (i.e., science) levels.

Here is my [CV]. You can find my publications [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/yzJT8uBtSWiFxHXu9T26mw).
